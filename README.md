## 🚀 Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Ensure you have a stable version of Node.js installed (LTS recommended).
* **npm**: The project includes a **`package-lock.json`** file, so **npm is the preferred package manager** to ensure exact dependency versions are installed.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/danishuahmad/inohealth-assessment.git](https://github.com/danishuahmad/inohealth-assessment.git)
    cd inohealth-assessment
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies (Preferred: npm):**
    Use npm to install all necessary dependencies, leveraging the lock file for consistency.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(If you must use Yarn, delete the `package-lock.json` file first, and run `yarn install`)*

3.  **Run the Development Server (Vite):**
    Start the Vite development server. This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
